- 👋 Hi, I’m James O'Rourke
- 👀 I’m a small business owner.  In a very distant past life I had my software engineer with decades of practical fortune 500 experience and success.  Decades later, I am back to square one but pleased to see UNIX survived.
- 🌱 I have insurance agencies.  I put together my own sites.  Rather simple at the moment but hoping to get my arms around my own SEO such as geo fencing, and other ventures using API.
- 💞️ Once I get some basic skills back, I would like to produce a nationwide site using a database of simple but HPIAA compliant entries for est 100,000,000 users.  They will log in a couple tiems in the first month then the account and record will sit idle for a decade before being updated.  Thinking of AWS integration.
